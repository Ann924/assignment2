        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "\n",
        "__Answer:__ This paper is about data tidying following the framework where each variable is a column, each row is an observation, and tables are a way to organize separate observational units.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "\n",
        "__Answer:__ The \"tidy data standard\" is intented to facilitate the exploration of data while simplifying the tools required for data analysis so that the person can focus on the domain rather than logistics of processing data.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "__Answer:__ The first sentence means that messy datasets can not be treated the same because they have different areas in which they are messy: however, tidy datasets can be processed similarly because they have been standardized into one uniform format. The second sentence speaks to the fact that it is difficult to determine the scope of a variable or observation (when to condense the information into one large component and when to break something apart into smaller components).\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "__Answer:__ Values are either quantitative or qualitative, and they can take the form of numbers or strings (respectively). Variables contain all the values that measure the same attribute across units. Observations contain all the values measured for the same unit across attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "__Answer:__ Tidy Data must satisfy the following: (1) each variable is a column, (2) each observation is a row, and (3) each type of observational unit is a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "__Answer:__ The 5 most common problems include: (1) column headers not being variable names, (2) multiple variables being stored in one column, (3) variables stored in rows and columns, (4) multiple observational units stored in one table, (5) observations for a single observational unit stored across multiple tables. Table 4 is messy because the headers are values and not names. Melting a dataset involves converting the columns to the rows and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "__Answer:__ Table 11 is messy because there are multiple observational unit types in one table (multiple days). On the other hand, by converting those days (currently as columns) to observational rows, table 12 becomes tidy and \"molten\" because it follows the tidy definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "__Answer:__ The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with tidy data is where the data and the tools are mutually dependent so it is difficult to see progress by only changing one. Wickham hopes that in the future, human factors will be able to improve data analysis from a cognitive perspective and allow for the design of improved data wrangling tools."
